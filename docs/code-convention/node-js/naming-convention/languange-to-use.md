# Language To Use

For naming variables and functions we will be using `English` as much as possible. The reason for this is since English is the dominant language that being used in programming language. You can found countless of documentations and educational materials that written in English. By writing the code in English it will increase the cohesiveness of your code.

## Code Example: using English for naming variables

```js
const firstName = 'Firdaus';
const languages = ['Typescript', 'C#', 'Python', 'Javascript'];
```

### Anti Pattern Code Example: using Bahasa for naming variables

```js
const namaDepan = 'Firdaus';
const bahasa = ['Typescript', 'C#', 'Python', 'Javascript'];
```
